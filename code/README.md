Due to some internal confusion, we mistakenly referred to year 3 as "year 2". Thus the processing done in `01_SPEAQeasy`, using the `SPEAQeasy` repo, was actually for year 3. Later, we were made aware of the mislabel and discovered that the real year 2 had not yet been processed. The directory `03_SPEAQeasy_Y2` was created to process the actual year 2, and uses a different version of SPEAQeasy under `SPEAQeasy_Y2`. The reason for this difference is a bug fix made between use of `SPEAQeasy` and `SPEAQeasy_Y2`. Manual work had to be done for year 3 to account for this bug, but data between years 1-3 is compatible, despite the differences in RNA-seq pipeline versions.
